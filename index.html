			<p>
				Ke is an MFA DT student in the Parsons the New School. Ke's works mainly focus on <a href="https://dribbble.com/jingquank">UI/UX</a> and <a href="http://jingquank.com/">digital arts</a>. Graduated with a psychology major background, he considered his works are more individual-driven, interpreting people's needs behind in a neutral way.

				Except Design, Ke is a huge fan of video game and literature. He is also an <a href="http://music.163.com/#/artist?id=12094679">indie musician</a>, composing music on piano for over 7 years.
